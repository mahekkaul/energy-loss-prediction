# âš¡ Energy Loss Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting energy losses using advanced regression techniques, data preprocessing, and feature engineering on multi-source datasets.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict **energy losses (Losses_kWh)** by analyzing feeder-level, solar, HT load, and tariff data. The goal is to assist utility companies in identifying high-loss areas and improving energy efficiency.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **GridSearchCV**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**

## ðŸ§  Key Features

âœ… Collected and merged multi-source datasets to create a unified energy consumption profile.  
âœ… Cleaned data with category-wise mean imputation and feeder-level statistical techniques.  
âœ… Engineered new features and encoded categorical variables for model readiness.  
âœ… Trained and tuned a **Random Forest Regressor** using **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters.  
âœ… Achieved improved **RÂ² score** and model performance on validation data.  
âœ… Visualized:
- Actual vs. Predicted Energy Losses
- Feature Importances
